# Open Civic Signal OS

Open system that converts citizen/community signals into an executable and auditable public backlog.

## Problem

Communities report needs constantly, but institutions struggle to prioritize with continuous evidence.

## MVP

- feedback collector data format (`examples/feedback.json`)
- transparent prioritization script (`npm run prioritize`)
- auditable output (`examples/prioritized-backlog.json`)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run prioritize
```

## Vision

Community voice should become visible, measurable, and actionable.
