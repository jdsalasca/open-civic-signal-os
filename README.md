## Demo

## Problem

Communities report needs constantly, but institutions struggle to prioritize with continuous evidence.

## MVP

- Feedback collector data format (`examples/feedback.json`)
- Transparent prioritization script (`npm run prioritize`)
- Auditable output (`examples/prioritized-backlog.json`)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run prioritize
```

## Public roadmap

- https://github.com/jdsalasca/open-civic-signal-os/issues/1
- https://github.com/jdsalasca/open-civic-signal-os/issues/2

## Landing page

- `docs/index.html` (ready for GitHub Pages)

## Vision

Community voice should become visible, measurable, and actionable.
