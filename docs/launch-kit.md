## LinkedIn post

Today I launched Open Civic Signal OS, an open source project to help communities and institutions prioritize needs with continuous evidence.

The MVP includes a transparent prioritization engine, auditable outputs, and a simple workflow that can be integrated with forms, bots, or civic channels.

If you work in civic tech, social innovation, or public service delivery, I would love your feedback and collaborations.

## Reddit post draft

Title: I built an open-source civic prioritization toolkit (community feedback -> auditable backlog)

Body:
I built a small open-source MVP to turn citizen/community signals into a reproducible prioritized backlog. The idea is to make public prioritization more transparent and easier to audit.

Would love feedback from civic tech folks and maintainers.
